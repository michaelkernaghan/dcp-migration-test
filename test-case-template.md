## Example Test Case

### Test Case ID: TST-001

### Basic Information
- **Test Name:** Verify User Account Snapshot Integrity
- **Created By:** Alex Johnson
- **Creation Date:** 2023-03-10
- **Migration Phase:** Phase 1: Data Snapshot
- **Priority:** High
- **Assigned To:** Sarah Chen

### Test Details
- **Description:**  
  Verify that the snapshot process correctly captures all user account data from the Tezos blockchain, ensuring integrity and completeness of the data.

- **Prerequisites:**
  1. Access to Tezos blockchain node
  2. Snapshot tool installed and configured
  3. Test accounts with known balances and transaction history

- **Test Environment:**
  - Development environment
  - Tezos node v12.3
  - Snapshot tool v1.5.2

### Test Steps
1. Select a representative sample of 20 user accounts from the Tezos blockchain
2. Record the current state of these accounts including: balances, transaction history, and NFT ownership
3. Execute the snapshot process targeting these accounts
4. Export the snapshot data to the specified format
5. Compare original blockchain data with the snapshot data for each account

### Expected Results
- All 20 accounts should be present in the snapshot
- Account balances in the snapshot should match the balances on the Tezos blockchain
- Transaction histories should be complete and match the blockchain records
- All associated NFTs should be correctly linked to their owners
- Data format should comply with the Base L3 import specifications

### Actual Results
- All 20 accounts were successfully captured in the snapshot
- Account balances matched exactly with blockchain records
- Transaction histories were complete and accurate
- All NFTs were correctly linked to owners
- Data format validated against Base L3 specifications

### Test Status
- **Status:** Passed
- **Execution Date:** 2023-03-12
- **Executed By:** Sarah Chen

### Evidence/Attachments
- Screenshot of account comparison results
- Log file from snapshot process
- Validation script output

### Notes
- The snapshot process took longer than expected (45 minutes vs. 30 minutes estimate)
- Recommend optimizing for larger scale snapshot process
- No data integrity issues were found
