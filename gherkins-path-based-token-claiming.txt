Feature: Social‑Login Migration 
    Background:
        Given the DCP → Base migration has finished
        And Web3auth has replaced Torus authentication

    Scenario: Google user completes migration
        Given the user logs in with Google
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "Yes" (I have an existing account)
        When the migration confirmation dialog appears
        Then it lists the preservation of reputation, FILMCredits → TALNT, and NFT migration
        When the user clicks "OK"
        Then asset discovery starts and all claimable assets are listed
        And each status transitions from ISSUING → ISSUED in real time
        When all assets are ISSUED the user clicks "OK"
        Then they land on their DCP dashboard with updated balances

    Scenario: Google user creates new account (with confirmation)
        Given the user logs in with Google
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "No" (I'm a new user)
        Then an orange warning appears asking for confirmation
        When the user confirms they want to create a new account
        Then a new DCP account is created and linked to their Google identity
        And they proceed through the new user onboarding flow

    Scenario: Twitter user links an existing account
        Given the user logs in with Twitter
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "Yes"
        Then a signing request is sent to their legacy wallet
        When the signature succeeds the Base‑Appchain dialog appears
        And the user proceeds as in *Google user completes migration*

    Scenario: Apple user with multiple email addresses
        Given the user logs in with Apple ID
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "Yes" (I have an existing account)
        Then the system prompts for manual account identification
        # Note: This prevents the Bryan account mix-up scenario
        When the user provides their DCP username or wallet address
        Then the system verifies their identity via signature
        And the migration proceeds normally

Feature: External‑Wallet Migration 
    Background:
        Given the DCP → Base migration has finished
        And the user opens the DCP app

    Scenario: Sentinel/Temple user migrates with EVM wallet
        Given the user connects a Tezos wallet (Sentinel or Temple)
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears and the user selects "Yes"
        Then a legacy‑wallet signature is requested and confirmed
        And the Base‑Appchain dialog shows the EVM address
        When the user clicks "OK" the Issuing screen appears
        Then DCP Ledger = ISSUING, External = UNISSUED
        When the user verifies address and authorises TALNT transfer (2 signatures)
        Then both sections become ISSUED and a completion dialog appears
        And selecting "OK" redirects to the main DCP application
        
Feature: Wallet‑Only Migration – Sentinel 
    Scenario: Sentinel user claims TALNT without a DCP account
        Given the user visits /migration/
        And connects a Sentinel T4L3NT wallet
        And connects an EVM wallet (Coinbase / MetaMask)
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "Yes" (I have tokens to claim)
        When the Issuing dialog appears asset statuses start at ISSUING / UNISSUED
        When the user signs "Verify T4L3NT Net Address" and "Authorise TALNT Transfer"
        Then both assets move to ISSUED and the "You're all set!" page shows balances
        
Feature: Wallet‑Only Migration – Ledger 
    Scenario: Ledger user claims TALNT via advanced flow
        Given the user selects the **Ledger** tab on /migration/
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "Yes" (I have tokens to claim)
        When the user connects the Ledger device and selects an account
        And connects an EVM wallet
        Then the flow mirrors **Sentinel user claims TALNT** with two signatures and final confirmation
        
Feature: Account Declaration Dialog Testing
    Scenario: User accidentally selects "No" but has existing account
        Given any user logs in with any method
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user mistakenly selects "No"
        Then an orange warning appears with text "Are you sure you want to create a new account?"
        When the user realizes their mistake and cancels
        Then they can select "Yes" to access their existing account
        
    Scenario: New user confirms account creation
        Given a genuine new user logs in
        When the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears
        And the user selects "No" (I'm a new user)
        And the orange warning appears
        When the user confirms they want to create a new account
        Then a new account is created successfully
        And they receive appropriate onboarding

Feature: Asset Status Engine 
    Scenario Outline: Status transitions per asset type
        Given the Issuing dialog shows <Asset> status <StartStatus>
        When the blockchain operation for <Asset> completes
        Then the status changes to ISSUED
    Examples:
        | Asset            | StartStatus |
        | DCP Ledger       | ISSUING     |
        | External Account | UNISSUED    |
        | FilmCrew NFTs    | UNISSUED    |
        
Feature: Failure & Retry Handling 
    Scenario: Transaction failure triggers automatic retry
        Given the user is claiming assets
        And the External Account transfer fails with a timeout
        Then the UI marks the transfer as FAILED and starts a retry
        When the retry succeeds the status becomes ISSUED and the flow continues

Feature: Web3auth Migration Issues Prevention
    Scenario: Bryan's Apple account scenario - Prevented
        Given Bryan has two accounts in the database:
        | Username      | Email                               | Auth Method |
        | bryan         | bryan.conway33@gmail.com           | Google      |
        | melsonnandela | bryan+prodapple@decentralized.pictures | Apple   |
        When Bryan logs in with Apple ID using email bryan.conway33@gmail.com
        Then the DCP Account Declaration dialog appears (no automatic email lookup)
        When Bryan selects "Yes" and manually identifies as "melsonnandela"
        Then the system correctly links to the melsonnandela account
        And migration proceeds with the correct account data
